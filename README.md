# About

This extension lets you see when a listing on eBay started using a simple table found below the listing's name.  This is especially helpful when determining how to price and sell your own items on eBay.

For instance, if you are trying to determine how best to price your item, you typically search for the same item on eBay and then browse the "Sold Items" listings to determine what people are willing to pay for the same item.  You find a low-priced listing for the same item and get discouraged that your item is not as valuable as you thought... but what if the listing sold in just a single day?  Maybe it was priced too low..!  Huzzah!!

This extension is intended to help you be a more informed, savvy seller on eBay.
